# PID-Component
If you are planning to use this component, please **only use the `display-magic` component**.

You can find the source code of the component [on GitHub](https://github.com/kit-data-manager/pid-component).
To import the component into your HTML page, use the following snippet:
```html
<head>
  <script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@kit-data-manager/pid-component"></script>
</head>
```

## Attention
**!!! All the other components (in the `prototypes` directory)are just a show of progress, deprecated and therefore very likely to be removed in the very near future!**
